      I'm <b>Mohsen</b>, a researcher and PhD candidate in Mechanical Engineering at <a href="https://www.wsu.edu">Washington State University</a> and part of the <a href="https://labs.wsu.edu/siaslab/">SIAS Lab</a>, advised by <a href="https://mme.wsu.edu/mme-personnel/wsu-profile/mehdi.hosseinzadeh/">Dr. Mehdi Hosseinzadeh</a>.

      My academic journey focuses on developing control theories, implementing them on real robots, and exploring robot interactions with humans. I am particularly interested in leveraging tools from applied analysis and partial differential equations to address challenges in real-world autonomy, and validating these methods on hardware across various robotic platforms (e.g., mobile robots, quadrupeds, and drones).Recently, I have also been working on human-robot interaction challenges, focusing on the safety and efficiency of both the robot and the interaction itself.
