I'm **Mohsen**, a researcher and PhD candidate in Mechanical Engineering at [Washington State University](https://www.wsu.edu) and part of the [SIAS Lab](https://labs.wsu.edu/siaslab/), advised by [Dr. Mehdi Hosseinzadeh](https://mme.wsu.edu/mme-personnel/wsu-profile/mehdi.hosseinzadeh/). My academic journey focuses on developing control theories, implementing them on real robots, and exploring robot interactions with humans.   
I am particularly interested in leveraging tools from applied analysis and partial differential equations to address challenges in real-world autonomy, and validating these methods on hardware across various robotic platforms (e.g., mobile robots, quadrupeds, drones etc).
