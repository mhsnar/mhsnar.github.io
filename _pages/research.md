      <h2>Safe and efficient Robot Interaction Planning in the presence of Unconcerned Human</h2>
      <p>When developing action planning for robots that interact with
humans, accurately predicting human actions is essential, as humans also
predict the robot’s actions in HRI environments. By taking human predic-
tions into account, robots can improve their ability to predict human actions
(left figure). Ignoring this aspect of human behavior can result in inaccurate
predictions and reduced efficiency by causing the robot to deviate from its
optimal path (right figure).</p>
